  Artificial Intelligence is the primary skill that all developers should spend time learning as soon as possible.
  AI agents are the way to unleash the full power of AI capabilities. 
  
  This AI Agents n8n Starter Kit will help you use AI agents to transform projects, tasks, and businesses
  to create potent AI-powered software.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are Large Language Models, aka LLMs, that have been given the ability to interact with the outside world. They
can do things like draft emails, book appointments in your CRM, create tasks in your task management software, and
do almost anything you can think of. I hope that everything I show here can help you dream big
and create incredible things with AI!

AI agents can be very powerful without having to create a lot of code. That doesn't mean there isn't room though
to create more complex applications by tying things together with many different agents to accomplish
amazing things. 

Below is a basic diagram to get an idea of what an AI agent looks like:

## How this Repo Works

Each week there will be a new video for my AI Agents Masterclass! Each video will have its own folder
in this repo, starting with [/1-first-agent/](/1-first-agent) for the first video in the masterclass
where I create our very first AI agent! 

Any folder that starts with a number is for a masterclass video. The other folders are for other content
on my YouTube channel. The other content goes very well with the masterclass series (think of it as
supplemental material) which is why it is here too!

The code in each folder will be exactly what I used/created in the accompanying masterclass video.
